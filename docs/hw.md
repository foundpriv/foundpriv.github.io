This homework is ungraded. Rather, it is designed to give you a sense
of how comfortable you are with various aspects of probability
theory. Probability theory can be a tricky subject, but it is
ultimately at the heart of understanding theoretical aspects of
privacy. You are not expected to know how to solve all of the
problems, but you should know how to solve at least a few. You should
submit at least 5 of the problems on Canvas so that the course staff
can get a sense of your familiarity with probability. (For example,
problem 1 (a) counts as one problem.) Questions marked with * are
trickier but provide extra insight into the topics being covered.

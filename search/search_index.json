Individuals share personal information with many different organizations - healthcare, financial and educational institutions, the census bureau, web services providers and online social networks - often in electronic form. Privacy violations occur when such personal information is inappropriately collected, shared or used. We will study privacy in a few settings where rigorous definitions and enforcement mechanisms are being developed. The primary focus of this course is differential privacy , a framework of designing data analysis algorithms with strong, meaningful, and mathematically provable privacy guarantees. We will survey a set of algorithmic tools that allow us to privately perform a wide range of statistical analyses and machine learning tasks. Of course, privacy does not come for free, and we will also study some of the fundamental limitations imposed by the requirement of differential privacy. We will also cover other topics related to privacy, including fairness and cryptography. Please see the calendar for individual lectures. Logistics Course : Foundations of Privacy, Fall 2021 Zoom Link : See Canvas Lecture Time : Fall 2021, 11:50AM--1:10PM EST, Mon & Weds Instructor Steven Wu Email : zstevenwu@cmu.edu Office hours : 2:00PM--2:45PM EST, Mon Location : Zoom link Teaching Assistants Justin Whitehouse Email : jwhiteho@andrew.cmu.edu Office hours : 2:00PM--3:00PM EST, Weds Location : Zoom link Shuaiqi Wang Email : shuaiqiw@andrew.cmu.edu Office hours : 2:00PM-3:00PM EST, Thurs Location : Zoom link Prerequisites This is a theory-oriented course, intended for graduate students and advanced undergraduates. The (informal) prerequisite is familiarity with probability, linear algebra, and introductory algorithms. Prior coursework in machine learning, algorithms, and probability will be helpful. Textbooks There is no need buy any textbook for this course. We will provide lecture notes in this course. In addition, we will frequently use the book The Algorithmic Foundations of Differential Privacy by Cynthia Dwork and Aaron Roth and The Complexity of Differential Privacy by Salil Vadhan . Accommodations for Students with Disabilities If you have a disability and are registered with the Office of Disability Resources, we encourage you to use their online system to notify us of your accommodations and discuss your needs with us as early in the semester as possible. We will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you suspect that you may have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office of Disability Resources, we encourage you to contact them at access@andrew.cmu.edu . Diversity Statement It is our goal that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives are well served by this course, that students\u2019 learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit. Dimensions of diversity include race, age, national origin, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, intellectual and physical ability, sexual orientation, faith and non-faith perspectives, socio-economic class, political ideology, education, primary language, family status, military experience, cognitive style, and communication style. We are intentional in our aim to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity, based on these dimensions and any other visible and invisible differences not captured in this list. Indeed, in this class you will learn to approach technology design from an empathetic, human-centered perspective that directly examines and challenges bias and inequality. Your suggestions for ensuring that the class lives up to these values are encouraged and welcomed. In addition, if at any time you experience or witness anything in this class that challenges inclusion, is insensitive or othering, or reinforces biases or stereotypes, please report those experiences (responses can be anonymous). Communication Canvas : We will be using Canvas for all assignments and grades. Please also post all questions on Canvas as discussions instead of sending emails. Email : If you email your instructors, you might want to include the substring \"[FoundPriv Course]\" to begin a meaningful subject line and have tried to resolve the issue appropriately otherwise. For example, you should post questions about course material and homework assignments on Canvas first, and then use emails only after an appropriate amount of time has passed without a response. Please use your CMU email account. Grading Percentage Activity 20% In-class Activity Participation 60% Assignment 1-4, 15% each 20% Take-home final, 20% When Work is Due Assignments are due on Sundays at 11:59pm. Late Assignments We realize that things happen, and that you might sometimes not be able to turn in your assignments. To accommodate this, you will each receive 5 free late days . Beyond those days, you receive a 5% penalty for each day late. You are welcome to budget late days as you like, for instance 3 free days late for one assignment, 2 for another, or all 5 for one. Special Accommodations If you have a disability and have an accommodation letter from the Disability Resources office, we encourage you to discuss your accommodations and needs with us as early in the semester as possible. We will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you suspect that you may have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office of Disability Resources, we encourage you to contact them at access@andrew.cmu.edu . Health & Wellness Take care of yourself. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress. All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is almost always helpful. If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is here to help: call 412-268-2922 and visit their website at http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/ . Consider reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to the support that can help. If you or someone you know is feeling suicidal or in danger of self-harm, call someone immediately, day or night: CaPS: 412-268-2922 Re:solve Crisis Network: 888-796-8226","title":"Syllabus"},{"location":"#foundations-of-privacy","text":"","title":"Foundations of Privacy"},{"location":"#overview","text":"Privacy is a significant concern in modern society.

Fast: KaTeX renders its math synchronously and doesn't need to reflow the page. See how it compares to a competitor in this speed test . Print quality: KaTeX\u2019s layout is based on Donald Knuth\u2019s TeX, the gold standard for math typesetting. Self contained: KaTeX has no dependencies and can easily be bundled with your website resources. Server side rendering: KaTeX produces the same output regardless of browser or environment, so you can pre-render expressions using Node.js and send them as plain HTML. KaTeX supports all major browsers, including Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Opera, Edge, and IE 9 - IE 11. More information can be found on the list of supported commands and on the wiki . Usage You can download KaTeX and host it on your server or include the katex.min.js and katex.min.css files on your page directly from a CDN: <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.0-alpha/dist/katex.min.css\" integrity=\"sha384-BTL0nVi8DnMrNdMQZG1Ww6yasK9ZGnUxL1ZWukXQ7fygA1py52yPp9W4wrR00VML\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"> <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.0-alpha/dist/katex.min.js\" integrity=\"sha384-y6SGsNt7yZECc4Pf86XmQhC4hG2wxL6Upkt9N1efhFxfh6wlxBH0mJiTE8XYclC1\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script> In-browser rendering Call katex.render with a TeX expression and a DOM element to render into: katex.render(\"c = \\\\pm\\\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\", element); To avoid escaping the backslash (double backslash), you can use String.raw (but beware that ${ , \\u and \\x may still need escaping): katex.render(String.raw`c = \\pm\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}`, element); If KaTeX can't parse the expression, it throws a katex.ParseError error. Server side rendering or rendering to a string To generate HTML on the server or to generate an HTML string of the rendered math, you can use katex.renderToString : var html = katex.renderToString(\"c = \\\\pm\\\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\"); // '<span class=\"katex\">...</span>' Make sure to include the CSS and font files, but there is no need to include the JavaScript. Like render , renderToString throws if it can't parse the expression. Security Any HTML generated by KaTeX should be safe from <script> or other code injection attacks. (See maxSize below for preventing large width/height visual affronts, and see maxExpand below for preventing infinite macro loop attacks.) Of course, it is always a good idea to sanitize the HTML, though you will need a rather generous whitelist (including some of SVG and MathML) to support all of KaTeX. Handling errors If KaTeX encounters an error (invalid or unsupported LaTeX) and throwOnError hasn't been set to false , then it will throw an exception of type katex.ParseError . The message in this error includes some of the LaTeX source code, so needs to be escaped if you want to render it to HTML. In particular, you should convert & , < , > characters to &amp; , &lt; , &gt; (e.g., using _.escape ) before including either LaTeX source code or exception messages in your HTML/DOM. (Failure to escape in this way makes a <script> injection attack possible if your LaTeX source is untrusted.) Alternatively, you can set throwOnError to false to use built-in behavior of rendering the LaTeX source code with hover text stating the error. Rendering options You can provide an object of options as the last argument to katex.render and katex.renderToString . Available options are: displayMode : boolean . If true the math will be rendered in display mode, which will put the math in display style (so \\int and \\sum are large, for example), and will center the math on the page on its own line. If false the math will be rendered in inline mode. (default: false ) throwOnError : boolean . If true (the default), KaTeX will throw a ParseError when it encounters an unsupported command or invalid LaTeX. If false , KaTeX will render unsupported commands as text, and render invalid LaTeX as its source code with hover text giving the error, in the color given by errorColor . errorColor : string . A color string given in the format \"#XXX\" or \"#XXXXXX\" . This option determines the color that unsupported commands and invalid LaTeX are rendered in when throwOnError is set to false . (default: #cc0000 ) macros : object . A collection of custom macros. Each macro is a property with a name like \\name (written \"\\\\name\" in JavaScript) which maps to a string that describes the expansion of the macro. Single-character keys can also be included in which case the character will be redefined as the given macro (similar to TeX active characters). This object will be modified if the LaTeX code defines its own macros via \\gdef , which enables consecutive calls to KaTeX to share state. colorIsTextColor : boolean . If true , \\color will work like LaTeX's \\textcolor , and take two arguments (e.g., \\color{blue}{hello} ), which restores the old behavior of KaTeX (pre-0.8.0). If false (the default), \\color will work like LaTeX's \\color , and take one argument (e.g., \\color{blue}hello ). In both cases, \\textcolor works as in LaTeX (e.g., \\textcolor{blue}{hello} ). maxSize : number . All user-specified sizes, e.g. in \\rule{500em}{500em} , will be capped to maxSize ems. If set to Infinity (the default), users can make elements and spaces arbitrarily large. maxExpand : number . Limit the number of macro expansions to the specified number, to prevent e.g. infinite macro loops. If set to Infinity , the macro expander will try to fully expand as in LaTeX. (default: 1000) strict : boolean or string or function (default: \"warn\" ). If false or \"ignore \", allow features that make writing LaTeX convenient but are not actually supported by (Xe)LaTeX (similar to MathJax). If true or \"error\" (LaTeX faithfulness mode), throw an error for any such transgressions. If \"warn\" (the default), warn about such behavior via console.warn . Provide a custom function handler(errorCode, errorMsg, token) to customize behavior depending on the type of transgression (summarized by the string code errorCode and detailed in errorMsg ); this function can also return \"ignore\" , \"error\" , or \"warn\" to use a built-in behavior. A list of such features and their errorCode s: \"unknownSymbol\" : Use of unknown Unicode symbol, which will likely also lead to warnings about missing character metrics, and layouts may be incorrect (especially in terms of vertical heights). \"unicodeTextInMathMode\" : Use of Unicode text characters in math mode. \"mathVsTextUnits\" : Mismatch of math vs. text commands and units/mode. A second category of errorCode s never throw errors, but their strictness affects the behavior of KaTeX: \"newLineInDisplayMode\" : Use of \\\\ or \\newline in display mode (outside an array/tabular environment). In strict mode, no line break results, as in LaTeX. For example: katex.render(\"c = \\\\pm\\\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\\\\in\\\\RR\", element, { displayMode: true, macros: { \"\\\\RR\": \"\\\\mathbb{R}\" } }); Automatic rendering of math on a page Math on the page can be automatically rendered using the auto-render extension. See the Auto-render README for more information. Font size and lengths By default, KaTeX math is rendered in a 1.21\u00d7 larger font than the surrounding context, which makes super- and subscripts easier to read. You can control this using CSS, for example: .katex { font-size: 1.1em; } KaTeX supports all TeX units, including absolute units like cm and in . Absolute units are currently scaled relative to the default TeX font size of 10pt, so that \\kern1cm produces the same results as \\kern2.845275em . As a result, relative and absolute units are both uniformly scaled relative to LaTeX with a 10pt font; for example, the rectangle \\rule{1cm}{1em} has the same aspect ratio in KaTeX as in LaTeX. However, because most browsers default to a larger font size, this typically means that a 1cm kern in KaTeX will appear larger than 1cm in browser units. Common Issues Many Markdown preprocessors, such as the one that Jekyll and GitHub Pages use, have a \"smart quotes\" feature. This changes ' to \u2019 which is an issue for math containing primes, e.g. f' . This can be worked around by defining a single character macro which changes them back, e.g. {\"\u2019\", \"'\"} . KaTeX follows LaTeX's rendering of aligned and matrix environments unlike MathJax. When displaying fractions one above another in these vertical layouts there may not be enough space between rows for people who are used to MathJax's rendering. The distance between rows can be adjusted by using \\\\[0.1em] instead of the standard line separator distance. KaTeX does not support the align environment because LaTeX doesn't support align in math mode. The aligned environment offers the same functionality but in math mode, so use that instead or define a macro that maps align to aligned . MathJax defines \\color to be like \\textcolor by default; set KaTeX's colorIsTextColor option to true for this behavior. KaTeX's default behavior matches MathJax with its color.js extension enabled.
